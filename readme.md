## Google oAuth 2.0 for ColdFusion ##

**Google oAuth 2.0 for ColdFusion** is a add in for your website which supports Google SSO and attaches to Google Contacts API and Google Calendar API.

### Works On ###
We aren't really sure, but we have tested it on Adobe ColdFusion 9, 10 and 2016.  It requires the use of components so if supports cfcs it should work.
